AUR/Foodworks resign

Sharing a win from last week!

Foodworks/AUR has re-engaged with .id for a second 6-month trial of our population forecasts and RDF. This time, were streamlining the delivery to make it even easier to use (taking away placemaker and delivering the rdf in a csv), addressing some of the challenges faced the first time (big thanks to Kamal Reddy and Darren Thomas for all the concordance tables). Theyve committed to a discounted rate to lock it into their FY25 budget, with delivery starting in January 2026 [??]

Catchment Report and forecast.id Premium for Bacchus Marsh Grammar

BMG is an independent school with approx. 3,800 students (prep-12) enrolled across two campuses: Maddingley Campus in Bacchus Marsh and Woodlea Campus in Aintree. These campuses are supported by a third, 200-acre property at Staughton Vale which is used by students from both main campuses.

They have engaged our consulting services to provide them with a Catchment Report for their region, including pop forecasts, demographics and an assessment of market share (amid existing and future competitors).

Community Views for City of Armadale in Perth

We've recently completed Community Views for City of Armadale in Perth's south-east.

The big issues in the community are safety, and improving the range and quality of shopping, leisure and dining experiences in the area. Interestingly, there is a strong connection between the extent to which people feel a sense of community and their feelings of safety - community building is something local Councils have plenty of agency over.

Armadale is an LGA with a very large range of liveability experiences - a liveability index as low as 49.4/100 in Forrestdale/Haynes/Hilbert area, compared to 62.4 in the newer housing estate of Piara Waters (see map attached). Not often you see such differences in directly neighbouring communities!

The platform for Armadale isn't public, so if you would like access let us know. Boris will be presenting the work with our Armadale client to the LG Professionals WA Council Planning Network.

Thank you to all those I bailed up to ask about the demographics, economics and future of the area to deepen my understanding!

Competitive RfQ win with South Australian Dept. of State Development

Hi,

We were successful in our bid with the SA Dept. of State Development (submitted on Monday). Value = $46,200 (GST incl.).

Project Summary:

We've been engaged to investigate the drivers of internal migration in and out of the state. The project combines detailed quantitative and qualitative research to understand who is moving, why, and what can be done to retain and attract talent. Deliverables include demographic profiling, employment and skills analysis, migration flow mapping, and lived-experience insights from our Living in Australia survey.

Value to client:

This work provides the Department with a clear, evidence-based foundation for population and workforce strategy, supporting efforts to address skill gaps and attract talent. Regional and state-level insights will enable targeted policy responses, while lived-experience data and emerging workforce values will help position South Australia more competitively.

Backed by our national expertise and proven tools, the project delivers actionable intelligence to guide planning and investment.

.id smarts winning tenders...

Preparing and responding to the RFQ highlighted our strength in aligning the right data and analytical methods to the specific questions asked, while also showcasing our ability to leverage existing assetslike the Living in South Australia (May 2025) surveyto gain a competitive edge. Building on this, Dan Evans has already proposed an extension of the SA survey sample to the client, which would enable a more detailed understanding of regional variation across the State.

A special thank you to Penny Bloomberg who helped me put together this response and Dan Evans for providing the subject matter expertise in the response as well as the interview earlier today.

Central Highlands Water: Culture in Action
One of the standout examples this year of collaboration, growth mindset, and positive behavioural shift is how we approached the Central Highlands Water opportunity.

Rather than relying solely on a traditional outbound sales method, we activated an integrated, cross-functional strategy:

Marketing innovation: Hedge enabled our lead scoring capability, helping us intelligently surface high-value leads at the right time. This wasnt just about better targeting, it was about enabling precision timing for sales engagement.

Just-in-time sales: With those lead signals in hand, the sales team was able to move in with 1:1 outreach exactly when the client was most receptive. This was a big shift from reactive to proactive, timely engagement, demonstrating real alignment between sales and marketing.

Local expertise and credibility: Bringing in Chris, with his deep knowledge of the Central Highlands area, helped us go beyond generic value propositions. He was able to deliver hyper-local, granular examples that built instant credibility and trust. This showed the value of leveraging internal networks and local context to strengthen the message.

The result? A seamless collaboration across disciplines, a data-informed, timely approach to outreach, and a pitch grounded in relevance and trust. Most importantly, it led to a successful close.   * Chatty G nailed this for me* thanks Chatty G [??]

Infrastructure WA looks to Community Views to make informed decisions!

In an effort to understand WA's key regional centre's needs better, Infrastructure WA has signed on to the Community Views service. The survey will encompass 7 x Regional WA local centres with a minimum sample of 2,900 respondents.

At this stage, the total contract value is $158K and comes off the back of a meeting held in Sydney in late May with Dan Evans, Rob Hall and the Value Australia team.

We continue to pursue a Stage 2 contract with IWA which will involve the precinct feasibility explorer as they embark on finding a solution to make better, more informed infrastructure decisions! #makingthebeststatebetter

Livingstone Shire Council signs for 3 years of Community Views
Following on from a couple of meetings between Dan [https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/personal-expressions/v2/assets/emoticons/dance/default/100_f.png] , myself [https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/personal-expressions/v2/assets/emoticons/1f920_facewithcowboyhat/default/100_f.png]  and the team at Livingstone (our very own Kat and a former colleague from Rockhampton, Skye are the key contacts and their Ec Dev team will also be involved) they had there budget bid approved last week and have signed up for 3 years of community views for a total contract value of 107K commencing in FY25/26.

This work will complement the consulting work that Keenan is currently doing for Livingstone to help them form up a bigger community and economic picture of Livingstone.

They are a small council (on the coast of Central Qld about 30 minutes from Rockhampton) and there community is growing quickly so this proves that a valuable tool like views can be appealing to smaller councils if their elected members are focused/driven by community views.

  *   Rolling out a quarterly dataset from Dec 2024 through Sept 2025,
  *   Kicking off a research project exploring how to integrate spending data (westpac) to estimate night-time expenditure more accurately.

This information is used by the NTE Commish in their insights publication (released quarterly) and supports their engagement with stakeholders across NSW (LGs, tourism agencies, state govt agencies, businesses, etc).

Hey Sally Blandy, about half the NTC $$ was already factored into our FY25 numbers and Livingstone's Views kicks in from FY26.  So pretty much same as this morning - $450k to land and deliver of which we have a strong belief in about $350k (Westpac, NEMA, Others, reduced churn). Still hunting for around $100k - give or take.

Stonnington Views 2.0

On the back of an excellent survey and service back in 2023 from Dan Evans + continuous communication (and a fair bit of hustling and budget wrangling)  Stonnington have signed on for a new survey & hosting circa 57K.

Back in 2023, Stonnington stood out as a highly liveable LGA, offering excellent access to services and fostering a welcoming community atmosphere. However, it also faced persistent challenges, including congestion, high housing costs, and issues with social connection. This year, it will be fascinating to see how Stonnington has progressed, especially in response to those 2023 challenges. The new evidence base and benchmarks that will be produced from the new survey will provide valuable support for their future strategic and policy decisions.

Western Sydney Uni (Centre for Western Sydney) adds Electoral Divisions

Western Sydney Uni (the Centre for Western Sydney) have been subscribers to a version of the community profile and economic profile for the whole of Western Sydney for many years. They do a lot of advocacy for the development of Western Sydney at the Federal and State Government level, and have a need for the demographic information at Electoral level to assist with their lobbying.

We're putting 28 State Electoral Divisions and 16 Commonwealth Electoral Divisions onto their existing profile so they can tell the changing story of each one of these. This is not the only work we do at electoral division level. We also have a long-term subscriber in the Western Australian Parliamentary Library who use the profile as a resource for their MPs and staffers.

CWS also have a need for one electoral division (Fowler, in the heart of multicultural Fairfield) to be online within a week, so thanks to the product team's responsiveness in saying they could meet this tight deadline, to get the whole deal over the line.

The client has $59k p.a. worth of subscriptions with us, going up to $67k p.a. with this addition. This also increases the relevancy of the toolkit for the CWS, where our main contact usually has to "pass the hat around" for funding the modules each year.

I have just received the signed 60K contract from Whitsunday Regional Council. Economy, profile & Atlas for 3 a Year Term.

WRC moved to REMPLAN 3 years ago so they were an early target for me when I started at id this year.

Keenan Jackson and I provided them with SOR data and me presenting with the Mayor in April at a council event. This coupled with a few past relationships has been key to our success.
This should now be a long term relationship if treated well.

Thanks to all involved. üí™

Well done Greg, Keenan and team!

To go with our revenue thermometer I feel we need a map of all LGAs coloured by provider. When we win one we get to colour it orange. So sweet to take one back from Remplan
