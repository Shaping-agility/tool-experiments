City of Bayswater expands .id toolkit

The City of Bayswater, WA subscribed to profile and economy for the first time last year, and this July received budget to add the population forecast and social atlas and become a 4-tool client. This is initially for a year, but the intention is to make this a long-term subscription. They are particularly interested in the forecast as the new Morley Station is part of Perth's railway network expansion and presents opportunities to densify and grow their housing in this area, they are keen to see what this looks like in the population forecasts.

Total annual contract value for Bayswater is now $46,950 p.a.

That's great! Their structure plan was just recently endorsed, and there is also more going into the Perth - North East SA4 than last time around due to more capacity within the SA4, particularly around their new train stations. It will be great to get their new forecasts hot off the press soon.

City of Canning re-signs for all 6 tools

The good folk at Canning have re-signed for all 6 tools, including another round of Community Views for FY 25/26. This will inform their major review of their Strategic Community Plan which has a 10 year horizon. They are on an annual contract basis but hopefully next year we can look at locking them in for a multi-year deal as the new team settles in (yes it does feel a tad awkward!). PFE has also been floated and met with interest as Canning has a couple of precincts they are looking to densify, along the new elevated rail corridor surrounding Queens Park and Cannington Station.

The total contract this year is approx. $120K, however on non survey years this will be about $88K per annum.

City of Newcastle signs on for Precinct Feasibility Explorer


City of Newcastle signs on for Precinct Feasibility Explorer worth $50,000 over next 3 months. The deal includes 6 month trial access of the beta PFE.


Quick Take


  *   Why they chose us: Need hard evidence to meet NSW housing targets and focus growth around four TOD stations. This will be a direct input into the masterplan being prepared by Architectus.

  *   Impact for .id: Second beta PFE deployment in NSW; showcases our ability to link policy and market feasibility, opening doors to many councils facing similar reforms.

  *   Go‑live / kick‑off: Consulting report for first 2 TODs, then beta access to PFE around October for customer to run scenarios for 2 extra TODs.


Why It Matters to the Client

Gives planners a realistic, data‑backed roadmap to hit the State Government TOD housing target without over‑stretching infrastructure or community support. Also means that the masterplan is viable, not theoretical.


How We Got Here

Seeded through our June 2025 briefing in June on Newcastle’s population and housing challenges plus demo of PFE. Big thanks to Nenad Petrovic and the team for preparing the briefing slides.


What’s Next / Opportunities

Strong potential for population forecast scenario integration; replicate PFE across NSW; feed client feedback into the PFE roadmap. Also provides an opportunity to consider how feasibility modelling can help inform population forecasts in TOD/infill areas.

Huon Valley Council sign onto 5 x Tools for 230k across 3 years...


I’m pleased to share that Huon Valley Council has just signed off on a significant new agreement with us, building on the strong foundation laid by the Community Views team in late FY25.


This three-year engagement will contribute over $230,000 in new business across FY26, FY27 and FY28. It includes five of our six key tools (Profile, Atlas, Economy, Housing and Community Views). While Council chose to not proceed with Forecast, they have allocated $15k PA for ad-hoc consulting work, giving them flexibility to commission tailored analysis, presentations, or reporting as needs arise.


It’s worth noting that Huon Valley serves a population of fewer than 20,000 residents – at the lower end of our Serviceable Market. Their decision to invest in such a comprehensive evidence base speaks volumes about the value they see in our work. The seed was planted in late 2024, when we first showed how these tools work together to support integrated strategy, planning, and advocacy.


There is absolutely no reason we can’t have at least a couple of hundred councils on this path—deeply engaged, using multiple tools, and embedding our insights across their organisation.


A big thank you to everyone who contributed to the work that’s led us here (shout out Jacquie Norton, Brigid Quinlan, Dieter Krusic-Golub).

The school is located in Tanunda SA and they approached us seeking better knowledge on "how external factors like demographics, competitor activity, job market, and housing markets etc, impact on future enrolments."

This study will support data-driven decision-making, enabling them to proactively plan for the future and ensuring they are well-positioned to adapt to changing demographic and economic conditions.

Macedon Ranges re-signs for 3+ years + adds Housing Monitor and Catchment Tool

The new SLA for is for 3 years (with options for 4 + 5) @ $65,038 p.a. Housing is particularly a key challenge Macedon  dealing with a shortage of affordable and social housing, rising rental and mortgage stress, and slow delivery of state-funded projects with only 13 of 26 promised social homes built so far. Macedon will use the Housing Monitor to track housing needs and to guide policy and the Catchment Tool will provide invaluable cross border intel from neighbouring high growth areas like Mitchell, Melton & Hume.

Shoalhaven Development Feasibility scenarios via the PFE
We received confirmation that the City of Shoalhaven wants to go ahead with the Precinct Feasibility Explorer solution to help them better understand the most feasible development scenarios for the Nowra and Bomaderry centres, which are impacted by NSWs Low and Mid-Rise housing policy.

The goal of this project is to help Shoalhaven Water plan asset management and capacity of water infrastructure more accurately while making cost-effective, and strategically justifiable infrastructure investments over a long-term planning horizon of 50 years, reviewed in 10-year increments.

Weve learned a lot during the preparation and revision of this proposal (once the scope shifted internally within council).

New South Wales has over 80 councils which also operate local water utilities. Many of them need to plan for future growth and service delivery, like Shoalhaven.

Local water utilities have been identified as an opportunity for the PFE and other scenario modelling were great at producing. Many local water utilities are part of LGAs that subscribe to 4+ .id tools, so Ill be working with some of you to turn council relationships into utility engagements.

Whitsunday Win

A good start to the new FY 🥳


I have just received the signed 60K contract from Whitsunday Regional Council. Economy, profile & Atlas for 3 a Year Term.


WRC moved to REMPLAN 3 years ago so they were an early target for me when I started at id this year.


Keenan Jackson and I provided them with SOR data and me presenting with the Mayor in April at a council event. This coupled with a few past relationships has been key to our success.

This should now be a long term relationship if treated well.


Thanks to all involved. 💪
