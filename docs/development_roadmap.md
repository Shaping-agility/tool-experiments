# Development Roadmap

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Refactor SalesLeadAnalyzer
- Apply the refactoring philosophy established in SalesAnalyzer:
  - Eliminate inline comments in favor of extracting code to well-named private methods.
  - Ensure all methods (public and private) have clear, comprehensive docstrings.
  - Make code intent self-evident through structure, not comments.

### 2. Refactor SpreadsheetManager
- Apply the same refactoring approach as above to SpreadsheetManager.

## Policy
- No new features or major enhancements should be started until the above refactorings are complete.
- This ensures a consistent, maintainable, and readable codebase for all future development.

## Future Steps
- After refactoring, review and update tests as needed to match any new method boundaries or behaviors.
- Continue to apply this philosophy to all new code and features.
