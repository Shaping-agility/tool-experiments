# Development Roadmap

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Teams Message Processing Interface Discovery ðŸ”„
**Priority**: Explore .eml file contents to determine optimal ChatThread interface

**Objective**: Work collaboratively to examine sample .eml files in data/raw folder and design the ChatThread class interface based on discovered structure.

**Tasks**:
- Analyze sample .eml files to understand Teams message structure
- Identify key data elements (participants, timestamps, messages, attachments)
- Design ChatThread class interface collaboratively
- Create initial prototype implementation
- Establish test patterns for email processing functionality

**Expected Outcome**: Clear interface design for ChatThread class that can effectively model Teams message threads from email data.

## Future Steps

- Implement ChatThread class and email processing capabilities.
- Develop Teams message analysis and markdown rendering features.
- Prepare for GraphAPI integration for real-time Teams data access.
