# Development Roadmap

## Completed âœ…

### 1. Teams Message Processing Interface Discovery âœ…
**Status**: COMPLETED - ChatThread and Message classes implemented with comprehensive test coverage

**Achievements**:
- Analyzed .eml files to understand Teams message structure
- Designed and implemented ChatThread and Message classes
- Created EmailChatThreadLoader for parsing .eml files into ChatThread objects
- Implemented markdown rendering for LLM-friendly output
- Added comprehensive test coverage including golden example tests
- Established stable participant ordering (by first appearance)
- Created batch loading capability (load_threadList)
- Generated sample outputs for validation

**Key Features Implemented**:
- ChatThread class with metadata, messages, and attachments
- Message class with participant, timestamp, content, and attachments
- EmailChatThreadLoader with robust .eml parsing
- to_markdown() method producing LLM-friendly output
- Comprehensive test suite with golden examples
- Batch processing of multiple .eml files

### 2. Monthly Summary Producer System âœ…
**Status**: COMPLETED - Automated monthly report generation system implemented

**Achievements**:
- Created MonthlySummaryProducer class for automated report generation
- Integrated existing SalesAnalyzer and SalesLeadAnalyzer functionality
- Implemented comprehensive chat threads processing (with date filtering disabled due to unreliable email dates)
- Added parameterized test coverage for multiple months/years
- Established robust file generation and error handling
- Created three output files: Sales Summary, Sales Lead Summary, and Chat Threads Summary

**Key Features Implemented**:
- MonthlySummaryProducer with date range calculation and file management
- Integration with existing sales analysis systems
- Chat threads processing with all available threads included
- Parameterized test suite covering May and June 2025 scenarios
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Automated file generation in data/processed directory

**Technical Decisions**:
- Disabled date filtering for chat threads due to unreliable email dates
- Added explanatory note in chat threads output about date filtering being disabled
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing analyzer interfaces
- Used parameterized tests for efficient test coverage across multiple scenarios

## Immediate Next Steps

### 3. GPT Integration and Business Intelligence Report Generation ðŸŽ¯
**Priority**: HIGH - Integrate with GPT for intelligent business report generation

**Objective**: Use GPT to analyze the generated monthly summaries (sales, leads, chat threads) and produce actionable business intelligence reports.

**Tasks**:
- **GPT Integration**: Set up GPT API integration for report analysis
- **Prompt Engineering**: Develop prompts that analyze monthly summaries and produce insights
- **Report Templates**: Create templates for different types of business intelligence reports
- **Data Validation**: Ensure GPT receives clean, well-structured data from monthly summaries
- **Output Formatting**: Design output formats for different stakeholders (executive, sales, operations)
- **Quality Assurance**: Implement validation for GPT-generated insights

**Expected Outcome**: 
- Working GPT integration for business intelligence
- Automated analysis of monthly summaries
- Actionable insights and recommendations
- Foundation for AI-powered business reporting

**Technical Requirements**:
- GPT API integration and authentication
- Prompt engineering for business analysis
- Output formatting and validation
- Error handling for API failures
- Cost management for API usage

### 4. Real Test Case Development and Validation ðŸŽ¯
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Validate system with real business scenarios

**Objective**: Test the complete system (monthly summaries + GPT analysis) with real business data and scenarios.

**Tasks**:
- **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete workflow from data to GPT insights
- **Business Validation**: Validate insights with business stakeholders
- **Performance Testing**: Test system performance with larger datasets
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Get feedback from intended users
- **Iterative Improvement**: Refine prompts and analysis based on feedback

**Expected Outcome**: 
- Validated business intelligence system
- User-approved report formats and insights
- Performance benchmarks for scaling
- Refined prompts and analysis methods
