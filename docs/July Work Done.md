Community Views for Ipswich

We're at the pointy end of delivering our sixth year of working with the City of Ipswich on Community Views (small pilot in 2020 followed by 5 full waves 2021-2025). Ipswich have four of our tools: profile, atlas, economy and views.

Brigid dazzled in her first presentation at .id, and the client is keen to incorporate Views and other data into their latest Corporate Plan, to show progress against key outcomes.

Our goal in this presentation was to highlight the range of data and insights we provide to Council in the context of their strategic planning agenda.

Slides attached for those interested.

Great job Jacquie Norton and Brigid Quinlan. Love seeing the link between actual population growth and how we can quantify the impact (and opportunity) it places on how residents engage with road congestion and public transport.

Community Views for the Huon Valley

Sorry to spam this channel - I'm on a roll! [??]

The Views team have almost completed Community Views for the Huon Valley in Tasmania (population <20K). The Huon team are a great bunch, and very engaged and enthusiastic about using the data as much as they can. With lots of work by the Council community engagement team, we managed to wrangle almost 1,250 responses - massive sample for such a small population. This was our second wave, with the first conducted way back in 2021.

Just wanted to highlight a way in which we have packaged up a summary of the results via a 'Key Insights Video'. The idea is that someone can get an understanding of the importance of the work for Council, as well as the key take-outs from the research, in less than 5 minutes. The video was quite efficient to put together in Canva as the slides had already been created for the Insights Workshop, and we utilised Canva's new AI Voice feature for the narrative. The quality of AI audio is getting better, and robot-factor is reducing (I think anyway, you be the judge!). Just a simple, quick way to be able to share our work in a (hopefully) engaging manner. Canva has four different Australian accent voices to choose from (and plenty of other accents).

Consulting Team - July

Here's some of the work the Consulting Team completed and billed in July:

Quote from Rob -  "there is increasing demand for understanding workforce needs given business challenges attracting workers. and this is only going to get harder with an ageing population. clear need for the health and care sectors. could expand our forecast offer to include workforce (where they live) forecasts by occ."

Green Economy  Northern Beaches (JK)

The need:

  *   Measure and analysis of the Northern Beaches green economy to support the Councils Economic Development Strategy and Environment and Climate Change Strategy.

How we did it and what we found:

  *   The client wanted a measure of the size of their green economy (in terms of jobs and value added), recent trends, and industry composition.
  *   The project also included a detailed greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) analysis with trends, industry breakdown, and insights into green energy usage. This analysis identified which industries and businesses to target for emissions reduction, and quantified the local transition towards renewable energy. The report also explored which green economy sectors to prioritise for future growth, drawing on global and national market trends, key opportunity areas, and local strengths.
  *   AI was heavily used to identify high-potential opportunity areas based on the current green economy, skills profile, and competitive advantages of the Northern Beaches.

The result:

  *   The Council will use the report to track progress, inform investment priorities, and guide future economic development decisions. A meeting with Council is scheduled next week to present the key findings and discuss next steps.

Joondalup Economic Health Check (KJ)

The need:

  *   Comprehensive overview of the economy and recent trends. Council wanted to use it to get a stocktake of progress against there economic development strategy focus area targets and also to identify potential areas for further investigation e.g. industry of precinct analysis.
  *   Manager of team said project wasnt needed, but his team members actually got commissioned. In feedback meeting Manager was actually impressed with the breadth of information in the report and the key findings.

How we did it and what we found;

  *   Report found that economy had become more concentrated in health and education in recent years. Professional business services jobs and business development growth was lower than metro average. Some recent public administration office investments by State Government are bringing in more white collar workers. Flow of residents in construction and mining to the north, and professional services to the south (CBD).
  *   The city would benefit from addressing fragmented office and innovation precinct infrastructure, modernising its suburban image through high-impact development and branding, attracting strategic public investments, streamlining development processes and exploring the creation of super-lots, and continued support for tech growth, entrepreneurship, and modern co-working spaces.
  *   AI deep research was used to identify potential reasons for why Joondalup innovation precinct is lagging, what elements does it lack to be an effective innovation precinct and what can enable more investment. AI was also used in part to summarise report findings (wasnt as good at doing this, couldnt summarise in concise enough format for my liking).

The result:

  *   Opportunities for application to other industries -  a spatial layer of key retail facilities/assets (potentially graded by size/quality) and commercial

Legal Aid NSW (NP & GA)

The need:

  *   The "State-wide Legal Need and Service Provision Assessment"  project for Legal Aid NSW will enable the client to more effectively focus resourcing, prioritising and funding to areas within NSW which require most urgent attention, depending on the service provided.

How we did it and what we found:

  *   Completed the Legal Aid NSW State-wide Legal Need and Service Provision Assessment analysis, reporting and mapping. The client was also provided with an executive report they can use in advocacy efforts. As the client initially wanted a solution via Placemaker but that tool is presently inadequate, we are also trialling an interactive dashboard for their five legal services (https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/a0b99c20-1eb3-4cac-b80e-262c94017f67<https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclaude.ai%2Fpublic%2Fartifacts%2Fa0b99c20-1eb3-4cac-b80e-262c94017f67&data=05%7C02%7Cmarkr%40id.com.au%7Cb0b405f4f7a34e113f9f08dddb6f9383%7C7617eb65676d49e5bbcb69b5e1fcf354%7C0%7C0%7C638907994437824757%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=sNQtvJe44hVAQgslMvgqaWQLJDd7Fx1DJrFMwuTzwtw%3D&reserved=0>).
  *   AI was heavily used in the data processing phases of this project, especially when 420,000 client records had to be analysed, grouped and have demand metrics calculated from. Use of ChatGPT o3 and o4.5 saved about one week of data processing and analysis and another week of structuring the report, before consultant experts enhanced and verified the AI output.

The result:

  *   This project is definitely an engagement we'd like to uplift to a product subscription when a DAP solution is built. That would enable more interactive use and understanding of service demand and enable periodic updates of data to be reflected in the client's DAP.
  *   The project proved that this sort of multi-service based demand/supply analysis is possible and can be applied to other opportunities we are working on, such as WA Courts, who Paul is speaking with. The analytic techniques, outputs, narrative and structure of recommendations provided to the client can be applied to other independent statutory authorities in Australia, e.g. Legal Aid Victoria.
  *   While we wait for full client feedback, one of our earlier provisions of results for an internal stakeholders show and tell was met with "The information and analysis you provided went down a treat and everyone (including us) is very excited about the report."

Great summary, thanks Ben. Id love to get back in the loop on Legal Aid and better understand the opportunity from a product perspective. I also agree with Robs observations.
In a sales conversation with Goodstart Early Learning this week, I asked whether access to labour factors into their site selection process and it does. Even if all other indicators look positive, they will rule out a location if they believe labour access is an issue. Thats not ideal when we think about ensuring appropriate access to childcare across the country, and its something we could help bring attention to.
They also spoke about the need to anticipate how a growth area will evolve over the next few years. For example, they focus on areas with low SEIFA scores. A growth area might look fine at the time of the census, but they know the profile will shift as new populations move in. We discussed the need for demographic data that updates from the census baseline to the current year and, ideally, includes forward forecasts.
That kind of evidence would help them go to their board and say, This area may not meet our current criteria, but it will by the time a centre is established.
Im going to set up a regular Voice of Customer meeting so we can start sharing these insights, and begin to brainstorm how we might dig into these challenges and prioritise them from a solution and eventually product perspective. Apologies for the essay

Sounds like they've got their heads well around this sort of stuff! We need resources and good examples of historic suburb transformation to speak to on how that sort of change can be anticipated. Focusing on SEIFA scores is interesting too, the growth SA2s we've been focusing on for KU tend to be really high due to the high proportion of dual-income earning families. It's great hearing how clients previously use demographic data. A customer voice meeting sounds like a great idea!

From Griffith - regarding eco/demo briefing and consultants using our impact modelling.

Thanks Glenn,

Really appreciate that, looks great! I can just add to the other .id reports I printed off for them. We also showed the consultants how to use the economic impact calculator, they were impressed.

Spoke with Kylie from Catholic Education SA. She shared how she is currently using .id Placemaker.

Current State (Pain Points)

  *   Uses .id Placemaker as the data source.
  *   Manually extracts data, screenshots maps, and formats them into Excel.
  *   Creates multiple tabs covering:
     *   School-aged population
     *   School information  (from another data source - ACARA)
     *   Early learning information (from another data source - ACEQA)
  *   Relies on manual layout work (call-out boxes, map images) for visual presentation.
  *   Takes about one week to complete each report.

Opportunity for the Emerging Demand Analytics Platform

  *   Automate compilation of these datasets into a single, integrated report.
  *   Replace manual screenshots
  *   Eliminate repetitive formatting by generating pre-designed report templates.
  *   Reduce delivery time from a week to potentially minutes.
  *   Support the delivery of a well presented story of population growth to share with stakeholders

Government Product work from July

We've been a bit quite on this channel, so wanted to share some of the team's achievements from this month. Also, Rob specifically asked me to. [??]

Identity Project

  *   Finalising FusionAuth set up and integration for .id
  *   Planning out integration with Community Views as the first LG app.
  *   Industry team are ready to be able to utilise this same capability in their products

Collecting client development assumptions

First cut of the portal ready and going live for WA and SA ahead of forecasting work commencing in those regions.

Household type forecasts

Added to priority clients. Hit a roadblock with rolling out to remaining clients. Product and Forecast team to confirm next steps this week.

Productivity and Tech debt

Added a plugin to QGIS to streamline the work on geographies for Population Forecast. This cut about 25% of the average job time and reduced the reliance on manual intervention. The time to deliver this was dramatically improved from the initial estimation by taking an AI-first approach, delivering in a couple of days what expected to take potentially a full sprint.

New client sites live:

  *   Whitsunday Regional Council (Community Profile, Social Atlas, Economic Profile)
  *   Blue Mountains Shire (Community Profile, Social Atlas, Economic Profile)
  *   Hay Shire (Community Profile, Economic Profile)
  *   Hobart City Council (Economic Profile)

Updated Population Forecasts (mostly converting to the National Forecast Program)

  *   Hornsby
  *   Eurobadalla
  *   Coffs Harbour
  *   Albury

Data updates

  *   Building approvals (Community Profile, Economic Profile, Housing Monitor)
  *   JobSeeker and Youth Allowance (Community Profile)
  *   ABR business listings (Economic Profile)

     *   View supplydemand analysis in a simplified, actionable format
     *   Apply custom site suitability criteria
  *   Introduced bulk upload functionality to allow multiple site assessments in a single session.
  *   Integrated with the 'Data Facade' layer (thanks to Josh), reducing data retrieval times from ~45 seconds to <1 second.
  *   Built foundational dashboard scaffolding to support dynamic, in-product reporting.
  *   Begun work to create login and user metrics to the platform
  *   Presented platform architecture strategy to the ELT.
