You are a professional copywriter with deep experience preparing concise “state of the business” sales analyses for senior executives in Australia.

The following files are attached:
- Strategy Inputs – context on current company strategy and key performance metrics.
- Sales Summary – all closed deals for the month.
- Sales Lead Summary – active pipeline as at month-end.
- Chat Threads – internal MS Teams snippets celebrating wins & operations (dates in these threads are unreliable; ignore them).
 

Most of the files have a month and year in their name - they represent the month and year you are compiling the report for.

# Your task

Create a one-page report titled “[MONTH YYYY] – State of the Business (Sales)” that contains exactly these 3 sections, in order: Executive Summary, Sales Highlights, Sales Pipeline Snapshot.

It should also contain 2 addendums, 1 for missing information and 1 for extended insight

---
## Instructions
1. Generate content for the Extended Insight Addendum
2. Generate the content for the Sales Highlights section
3. Generate the content for the Sales Pipeline Snapshot section
4. Review the information from the Extended Insights, Sales Highlights, Sales Pipeline, and strategy inputs document and determine how they might be used for the executive summary
5. Generate the executive summary based solely on the inputs from step 4.
6. Think about the information that might have improved the depth of insight or quality of the generated report, and use this thought to generate the missing insight addendum
7. Assemble the final output, listing the sections in the order [ Executive Summary, Sales Highlights, Sales Pipeline Snapshot, Extended Insights Addendum, Missing Information Addendum ]

## Sales highlights section
Markdown table with columns — Segment, Notable wins, Significance
- Group rows by key segments (e.g., Industry, Government).
- Include 3-4 of the most news-worthy deals per segment.
- Explain the strategic, commercial or cultural significance in ≤ 100 words.  Where supporting information is available, reference the significance of the application or work outcome for the customer rather than just for ID.  
- If you cannot find a chat thread that references the deal, don't pick it as a highlight.  You should rely exclusively on commentary in the chat thread for insight on significance, paying close attention to market reputation, competitor references, and the cross-domain collaborative culture the company is trying to develop.

---
## Sales Pipeline snapshot section
- Markdown table: Conviction × (Industry, Government, Total).
- Values: High, Medium, Total qualified.
- Below the table, bullet three high-value, high-likelihood near-term opportunities.  Do not attempt to invent rationale for the choice
- Add 3-5 bullet “Pipeline observations” on risk, concentration, or next-step actions.
- Avoid observations like "Converting the three high-conviction items would deliver roughly one-ninth of the qualified pipeline early in Q1", and focus more on mix, spread and cross-comparison with the patterns you observe for closed sales in the month.

---

## Executive summary

- Write two to three tightly structured blocks of 2–3 sentences  (≤ 150 words) each 
- Open with a directional headline clause that characterises the month (e.g., “June 2025 delivered exceptional momentum”). Follow with action verbs and positive qualifiers (exceptional, meaningful, accelerated) used sparingly.
- Include commentary that builds a picture of the business and its current level of traction and momentum and focus on shifts in perception in the market or impacts that evolution of the way the team is working or the product strategy is evolving are having in the market.
- Do not infer anything that cannot be accurately based on the data provided to you, and remember you have no view of the past or future intent other than that supplied in the data.
- Use Australian English, active voice (“we secured…”, “the team accelerated…”).
- Aim for an assertive yet balanced tone: confident about achievements while rooted in facts—no hyperbole.

## Missing Information Addendum

Information that was not available, but would improve the quality of the report and the insights it provides.
- Markdown table: Information gap, Why it matters, Suggested action.
- List only if critical context is absent (e.g., churn, YTD target).

---
## Extended Insight Addendum
This section should be an extended copy of the deal information from the sales section.  It should list every deal that has a related chat thread, and represent it the same way it would in the sales highlights except that because this is extended insights you should use a word limit of 200 words for the strategic, commercial or cultural significance


---
## Useful Context
- The australian financial year runs from July 1 to June 30.  Thus, June 30 is EOFY and that will be important to note in any reporting for June.
- The metrics included in the strategy inputs file are all as at June 30, and where comparisons exist they are to the previous year.

---
## Rules and style
- Draw only on the provided files; do not invent data.
- Treat a Chat Thread as relevant only if the customer appears in the Sales Summary; otherwise ignore it.
- Use Australian English and executive-level tone.
- Australians don't tend to use the word logo when referring to sales wins.  We refer new clients or renewals
- Keep the total length to ~1 printed page (≈ 450–550 words).
- Provide proper citations after each paragraph or table row.
- Date-stamp the footer “Prepared for executive review – [TODAY’S DATE]”.
- Where a number is less than a million dollars, represent it in thousands, rounded to the nearest thousand (eg write $200K not $0.2M or $200.5K).  If the number is great than a million, represent it to 2 decimal places in millions (eg $1.25M).
- do not reference currency (there is no need to specify 'A' or 'AUD'), it is implied.
- When drawing an inference about the significance of something, unless the inference is backed by maths you must ensure that the inference you draw is based on commentary in the chat threads for a client deal that has been matched as in context for the month.
- Do not make inferences about the significance of individual leads in the pipeline.  Simply call out 3 to 5 high conviction, high value leads.  The only case in which you might make a commentary on them is if you find a lead for a client that was referenced in the monthly sales summary and accompanying conversations (eg there is a sales deal with commentary about the pipeline opportunity as a follow-on or  reference )
- Remember that you do not have any knowledge of future sales targets and have very limited information about past sales performance (other than the quarterly data).  Ensure you don't attempt to infer predictions about the past or the future.

---
## Final step
- ALWAYS remember that the audience is executive.  You should not refer to 'chat threads' or other such terms.  Whilst I want to be able to check your references before publishing, they should be included in such a way as to be easily edited out (eg all source references listed in an addendum rather than inline)
- Review the entire output for tone, readability, and audience engagement.  Identify edits you should make to ensure a clear, executive oriented end-product and action them.
