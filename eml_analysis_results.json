Interestingly, there is a strong connection between the extent to which people feel a sense of community and their feelings of safety - community building is something local Councils have plenty of agency over.\n\n\n\nArmadale is an LGA with a very large range of liveability experiences - a liveability index as low as 49.4/100 in Forrestdale/Haynes/Hilbert area, compared to 62.4 in the newer housing estate of Piara Waters (see map attached). Not often you see such differences in directly neighbouring communities!\n\n\n\nThe platform for Armadale isn't public, so if you would like access let us know. Boris will be presenting the work with our Armadale client to the LG Professionals WA Council Planning Network.\n\n\n\nThank you to all those I bailed up to ask about the demographics, economics and future of the area to deepen my understanding!\n"

Value = $46,200 (GST incl.).\n\n\n\nProject Summary:\n\nWe've been engaged to investigate the drivers of internal migration in and out of the state. The project combines detailed quantitative and qualitative research to understand who is moving, why, and what can be done to retain and attract talent. Deliverables include demographic profiling, employment and skills analysis, migration flow mapping, and lived-experience insights from our Living in Australia survey.\n\n\n\nValue to client:\n\nThis work provides the Department with a clear, evidence-based foundation for population and workforce strategy, supporting efforts to address skill gaps and attract talent. Regional and state-level insights will enable targeted policy responses, while lived-experience data and emerging workforce values will help position South Australia more competitively.\n\n\n\nBacked by our national expertise and proven tools, the project delivers actionable intelligence to guide planning and investment.\n\n\n\n.id smarts winning tenders...\n\nPreparing and responding to the RFQ highlighted our strength in aligning the right data and analytical methods to the specific questions asked, while also showcasing our ability to leverage existing assetslike the Living in South Australia (May 2025) surveyto gain a competitive edge. Building on this, Dan Evans has already proposed an extension of the SA survey sample to the client, which would enable a more detailed understanding of regional variation across the State.\n\n\n\nA special thank you to Penny Bloomberg who helped me put together this response and Dan Evans for providing the subject matter expertise in the response as well as the interview earlier today.\n\n[cid:ed7993ef-a408-4552-b5ec-6a12e211e11e]"

This wasnt just about better targeting, it was about enabling precision timing for sales engagement.\n\n\n\nJust-in-time sales: With those lead signals in hand, the sales team was able to move in with 1:1 outreach exactly when the client was most receptive. This was a big shift from reactive to proactive, timely engagement, demonstrating real alignment between sales and marketing.\n\n\n\nLocal expertise and credibility: Bringing in Chris, with his deep knowledge of the Central Highlands area, helped us go beyond generic value propositions. He was able to deliver hyper-local, granular examples that built instant credibility and trust. This showed the value of leveraging internal networks and local context to strengthen the message.\n\n\n\nThe result? A seamless collaboration across disciplines, a data-informed, timely approach to outreach, and a pitch grounded in relevance and trust. Most importantly, it led to a successful close.   * Chatty G nailed this for me* thanks Chatty G [??]\n"

They do a lot of advocacy for the development of Western Sydney at the Federal and State Government level, and have a need for the demographic information at Electoral level to assist with their lobbying.\n\n\n\nWe're putting 28 State Electoral Divisions and 16 Commonwealth Electoral Divisions onto their existing profile so they can tell the changing story of each one of these. This is not the only work we do at electoral division level. We also have a long-term subscriber in the Western Australian Parliamentary Library who use the profile as a resource for their MPs and staffers.\n\n\n\nCWS also have a need for one electoral division (Fowler, in the heart of multicultural Fairfield) to be online within a week, so thanks to the product team's responsiveness in saying they could meet this tight deadline, to get the whole deal over the line.\n\n\n\nThe client has $59k p.a. worth of subscriptions with us, going up to $67k p.a. with this addition. This also increases the relevancy of the toolkit for the CWS, where our main contact usually has to \"pass the hat around\" for funding the modules each year.\n\n[cid:e2c34f6b-94d2-4934-8681-3caae78862d7]"
